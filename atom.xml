    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to CodeCrunch.io, this is my personal blogging website where I will write guides, fixes and any issues that I have found as a developer.<br><a id="more"></a><br>I started web development in June 2014 and I have learnt so much in that time and I found reading blog posts, articles and stack overflow to be a huge part of my learning process.<br>Now that I am working fulltime at a digital agency in London I thought it would be a good time for me to write some posts about the problems that I come across in my day to day life as a developer (there are many!) and hopefully developers new and experienced can learn something from my posts.<br>I primarily work with Ruby on Rails and AngularJs, so the majority of my posts<br>will focus around these, but I will be teaching myself Node fairly soon.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this blog and any feedback would be great. If you want to ask me any questions<br>then just leave comments below or you can follow me on Twitter: @ThatTobMate</p>
